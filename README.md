## Endrose Chain

**Endrose Chain** is a conceptual project designed to demonstrate how a blockchain works, specifically in the context of tracking a food supply chain to prevent counterfeiting.

### Project Overview

This project primarily illustrates how blockchain technology can be utilized to trace and verify the origin of food products. By using transaction hashes and ledger data, it showcases the transparency and security that blockchain can bring to the food supply chain.

### How It Works

The algorithm implemented in this project follows these steps:

1. **Raw Material Entry**:
   - Raw materials are entered into the blockchain, generating a transaction hash.

2. **Supplier to Producer**:
   - The supplier delivers the raw materials to the producer, creating another transaction hash.

3. **Production**:
   - The producer processes the raw materials into finished products, which is recorded with a transaction hash.

4. **Distribution**:
   - The vendor sells the product to the customer, and a transaction hash is generated.

5. **Customer Verification**:
   - Before purchasing, the customer can scan the transaction in the ledger.
   - Scanning provides full details of the product's lifecycle, from raw material to finished product.

### Demonstration

The system described above is demonstrated through this project using an Android app, providing a practical example of how blockchain can enhance transparency and trust in the food supply chain.
